#Summury/results
- finally it is and will always be a trade time <-> quality
- sophisticated enhancements that try not to make this trate have liddle to no effekt. (or we are to stupid -> TODO find euphemism )
- trees suffer the weakness, that they don not trick players into errors
- The Simpler the better for the heuristic
- no shure conclusions to bigger trees (or deeper evaluation ) can be drawn
- different results for chess and in a row showcase, that the behavior show something about the games, not only about algorithms
    - in chess the strategie is needet for winning, in a in a row game it is needet for

## Further Reasearch recommendation
- just scached the surface bla-bla -> but found a lot of new potentials for papers based on this
- could dig deeper into other games -> searching for game-families with simular behavior
- could research more algorithims
- repeat reasearch with bigger and broader trees (with bigger infrastructure)

#Conclusion
We found that the Algorithms we tryed can not even keep up with brute force,
so the value of our work - contray to our expectations
 - is that we providet a framwork for such research.
